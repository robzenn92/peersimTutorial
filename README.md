# PeerSim Tutorial

### Introduction to PeerSim

Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems can be extremely large scale (millions of nodes). Nodes in the network join and leave continuously. Experimenting with a protocol in such an environment it no easy task at all.
PeerSim has been developed to cope with these properties and thus to reach extreme scala- bility and to support dynamism [1].

PeerSim source code can be downloaded from [http://peersim.sourceforge.net](http://peersim.sourceforge.net/).
