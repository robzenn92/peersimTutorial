     * To do so, each process p maintains a received map of (id, event) pairs with all known but not yet delivered events
     * and a delivered set with all the events already delivered to the application.
     *
     * The main task of this procedure is to move events from the received set to the delivered set,
     * preserving the total order of the events. This is done in several steps as follows.
     *
     * We start by incrementing the ttl of all events previously received (lines 6â€“7) to indicate the start of a new round.
